# Technical Problem Solving: LeetCode

This repository serves as a professional record of my daily practice in data structures and algorithmic efficiency using Python. 

## Philosophy
- **Human-Centric Development:** Every solution is derived independently to ensure a deep understanding of logic and optimization.
- **Code Quality:** Prioritizing clean, Pythonic implementations that adhere to $O(n)$ or better time complexity.
- **Documentation:** Each entry includes a post-mortem analysis of the approach, logic, and complexity.

## Technical Focus
- **Languages:** Python 3.x
- **Core Topics:** Arrays, Hash Tables, String Manipulation, Linked Lists, and Dynamic Programming.
- **Goal:** 365 days of continuous technical growth.
